Python Chess

by Peter Carter, Nick Kelly, and Arian Jahjaga

    The project that we are proposing is essentially just the creation of a chess app in Python. The goals of the project
include relearning python, learning how to write a complex AI algorithm, and potentially work with networking. We
arenâ€™t attempting to innovate and create a completely new product, we are simply working on solidifying our knowledges
of the technologies required by this project.

We will be following a very standard software development cycle, working in sprints and submitting deliverables every
few weeks. The team will meet several times throughout each sprint, and specifically at the start of each sprint we
will have a planning meeting to allocate work and discuss goals.

While the exact structure of the product has not been entirely accounted for, we have come up with targets to aim for
during each sprint. Ultimately, the final deliverable will be a python application that can be run from a desktop
shortcut. Users will be taken to a start screen GUI that allows them to start a local game on their own computer, or
to play against an AI. If the player chooses an AI, they will then choose a starting color and an AI difficulty. If the
team works ahead of schedule and knocks out the final product with lots of time to spare, we will consider adding
potentially more enhancements like online play, ranking, and replays.
