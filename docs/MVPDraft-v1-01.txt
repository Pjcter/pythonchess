Our program must meet the following requirements to be defined as functional. The program must display a graphical chess board to the user, with pieces displayed on top of it. The pieces must be movable using the mouse, with legality of the attempted moves determined by the program as opposed to simply the users knowledge (ex. if the user tries to move a Knight in a straight line, the program will prevent this). The program must also declare when one user has put the other in check and checkmate.
