<h2 id="minimum-viable-product-summary">Minimum Viable Product Summary</h2>
<p>Our minimum viable product will be a Python executable that can be run from a desktop shortcut. Upon opening, users will be taken to a start screen where they may select to play a local game against another player or against an AI. Upon starting a game, users will be able to play legal chess as defined by the US Chess Federation’s rules.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Our product must meet the following requirements to be defined as functional: * Players can launch a Python executable from their desktop * Players can select either to start a local normal game, or against an AI * Upon starting a game, a chess board is displayed with pieces on top of it * Pieces must be move-able via drag and drop. * Game play follows the rules of the US Chess Federation. * Games will conclude when checkmate is reached.</p>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Our model is comprised of the following pieces:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Board: This represents a chess board. It is made up of 64 squares</li>
<li>Square: A single square on a chess board. It has a color attribute, and a coordinate.</li>
<li>Piece: This is a super class representing all chess pieces. It has a type attribute, color, and makes moves</li>
<li>Pawn, Rook, King, Queen, Knight, Bishop: These will all be subclasses of Piece, with essentially unique interpretations of a ‘move’ function.</li>
<li>Player: represents one of the two players in a game of chess.</li>
<li>Move: represents the move of a piece from one spot to another.</li>
<li>Ruleset: A set of rules that dictate if a move is legal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="model-view-controller">Model View Controller</h3>
<p>The general structure of our project will follow a model view controller (MVC) pattern.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of MVC design within a chess game:</p>
<p><img src="mvc_diagram.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Model Tier: composed of Python classes representing entities described in our domain model. Chess buisness logic lives here.</li>
<li>Controller Tier: Composed of UI Controller classes written in Python. These will handle requests from the GUI. Valid requests, namely valid moves or button presses, are relayed to the model.</li>
<li>View: Our view is a Pygame GUI representing a chess board. Requests will be sent by dragging and dropping chess pieces</li>
</ul>
