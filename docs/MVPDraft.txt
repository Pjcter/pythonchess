In order to streamline the development of our chess game, we must define clear minimums that our project must meet in
order to defined as functioning. Without these clear minimums defined, it would be easy to become stuck developing an
advanced or niche feature of the code for an extended period of time, while forgetting about the base functionality
that must be met. At a minimum, our program must meet the following requirements to be defined as functional. The
program must display a graphical chess board to the user, with pieces on top of it. The pieces must be movable using
the mouse, with legality of the attempted moves determined by the program as opposed to simply the users knowledge (ex.
if the user tries to move a Knight in a straight line, the program will prevent this).
